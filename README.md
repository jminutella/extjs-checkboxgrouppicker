# extjs-checkboxgrouppicker

This is a sample ExtJS 6.2 custom component called CheckBoxGroupPicker. 

I wrote the CheckBoxGroupPicker custom component because I needed a checkboxgroup component inside of a combobox that I can use to select checkboxes and have the values populated inside of the combobox. Sencha doesn't have any components out of the box that does this. 

I didn't include an entire ExtJS sample application because there isn't that much code. An important thing to note is that when instantiated the CheckBoxGroupPicker class, you can pass in a checkbox collection and a listeners collection. 

 - `"app.js"` - This class shows an example of how you can use the CheckBoxGroupPicker component
 - `"CheckBoxGroupPicker.js"` - The CheckBoxGroupPicker custom component class
 
 I also created a fiddle to provide a working example: https://fiddle.sencha.com/#view/editor&fiddle/1urg
